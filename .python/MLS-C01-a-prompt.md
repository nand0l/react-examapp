# Intructions

I have a multiplechoice question, 
I need you to read the questtion an select the best answer(s) form the list with possible answers, 
Do not make ant assumptions, 
Use only the information from the question.
ExamID is the title-entry of the document.
Include also the Question text and the possible anwers section in the output just as in the example-output-format
do NOT include the <example-output-format> and </example-output-format> in the json output
do NOT use the ExamID from this example but use the ExamID from the source-code.

    "ExamID": "MLS-C01-V2",
    "QuestionID": "112",
    "Answer": "B",
    "CorrectAnswers": "B. Deploy the model on AWS IoT Greengrass in each factory. Run sensor data through this model to infer which machines need maintenance.",
    "Explanation": "B is the best answer because it addresses the key requirements:\n\n1. Near-real-time inference capabilities: AWS IoT Greengrass allows for local processing and inference at the edge, which meets the need for near-real-time capabilities.\n\n2. Unreliable or low-speed internet connectivity: By deploying the model on AWS IoT Greengrass in each factory, the solution can operate even with poor internet connectivity, as the processing happens locally.\n\n3. Complex sensor data analysis: IoT Greengrass can handle the processing of the complex sensor data (up to 200 data points per machine) locally.\n\n4. Preemptive maintenance identification: The local model can continuously analyze the sensor data to identify equipment needing maintenance.\n\nOptions A, C, and D all rely on cloud-based processing, which would be problematic given the unreliable internet connectivity mentioned in the question. These options would not provide the near-real-time capabilities required when internet connectivity is poor or unavailable.",
    "PossibleAnswers": [
        "A. Deploy the model in Amazon SageMaker. Run sensor data through this model to predict which machines need maintenance.\n",
        "B. Deploy the model on AWS IoT Greengrass in each factory. Run sensor data through this model to infer which machines need maintenance.\n",
        "C. Deploy the model to an Amazon SageMaker batch transformation job. Generate inferences in a daily batch report to identify machines that need maintenance.\n",
        "D. Deploy the model in Amazon SageMaker and use an IoT rule to write data to an Amazon DynamoDB table. Consume a DynamoDB stream from the table with an AWS Lambda function to invoke the endpoint."
    ],
    "QuestionText": "A manufacturer is operating a large number of factories with a complex supply chain relationship where unexpected downtime of a machine can cause production to stop at several factories. A data scientist wants to analyze sensor data from the factories to identify equipment in need of preemptive maintenance and then dispatch a service team to prevent unplanned downtime. The sensor readings from a single machine can include up to 200 data points including temperatures, voltages, vibrations, RPMs, and pressure readings.\nTo collect this sensor data, the manufacturer deployed Wi-Fi and LANs across the factories. Even though many factory locations do not have reliable or high- speed internet connectivity, the manufacturer would like to maintain near-real-time inference capabilities.\nWhich deployment architecture for the model will address these business requirements?"
