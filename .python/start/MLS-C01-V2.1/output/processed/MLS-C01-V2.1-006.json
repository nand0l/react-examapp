    "ExamID": "MLS-C01-V2.1",
    "QuestionID": "006",
    "Answer": "B",
    "CorrectAnswers": "B. Use AWS Glue to catalogue the data and Amazon Athena to run queries",
    "Explanation": "Option B is the best answer because it requires the least effort to query the data stored in an S3 bucket using SQL. AWS Glue can automatically discover and catalog the metadata of both structured and unstructured data in S3, creating a unified data catalog. Amazon Athena can then use this catalog to run SQL queries directly on the data in S3, without the need for data transformation or moving the data to a separate database. This solution provides a serverless approach that requires minimal setup and maintenance, making it the least effort-intensive option.",
    "PossibleAnswers": [
        "A. Use AWS Data Pipeline to transform the data and Amazon RDS to run queries.",
        "B. Use AWS Glue to catalogue the data and Amazon Athena to run queries",
        "C. Use AWS Batch to run ETL on the data and Amazon Aurora to run the quenes",
        "D. Use AWS Lambda to transform the data and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to run queries"
    ],
