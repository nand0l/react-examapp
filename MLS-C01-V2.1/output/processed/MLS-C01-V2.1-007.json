    "QuestionID": "007",
    "Answer": "B",
    "CorrectAnswers": "B. Build the Docker container to be NVIDIA-Docker compatible",
    "Explanation": "To leverage NVIDIA GPUs in a Docker container for Amazon SageMaker training on EC2 P3 instances, the container needs to be NVIDIA-Docker compatible. This ensures that the container can properly access and utilize the GPU resources provided by the EC2 P3 instances. NVIDIA-Docker compatibility allows the container to interface with the GPU drivers on the host system, enabling efficient GPU utilization for machine learning tasks.",
    "PossibleAnswers": [
        "A. Bundle the NVIDIA drivers with the Docker image\n",
        "B. Build the Docker container to be NVIDIA-Docker compatible\n",
        "C. Organize the Docker container's file structure to execute on GPU instances.\n",
        "D. Set the GPU flag in the Amazon SageMaker Create TrainingJob request body"
    ],
    "QuestionText": "A Machine Learning Specialist is packaging a custom ResNet model into a Docker container so the company can leverage Amazon SageMaker for training The Specialist is using Amazon EC2 P3 instances to train the model and needs to properly configure the Docker container to leverage the NVIDIA GPUs.\nWhat does the Specialist need to do1?"
