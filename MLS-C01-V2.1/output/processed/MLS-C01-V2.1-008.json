    "ExamID": "MLS-C01-V2.1",
    "QuestionID": "008",
    "Answer": "C",
    "CorrectAnswers": "C. Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC and create an S3 VPC endpoint for the notebook to access the data Define a custom S3 bucket policy to only allow requests from your VPC to access the S3 bucket",
    "Explanation": "Option C is the best answer because it addresses both the security and access requirements:\n\n1. It launches the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC, ensuring network isolation.\n2. It creates an S3 VPC endpoint, allowing the notebook to access S3 data without going through the public internet.\n3. It defines a custom S3 bucket policy to only allow requests from the specific VPC, maintaining the privacy and integrity of the data.\n\nThis solution provides secure access to the data while allowing the Specialist to explore it from the SageMaker notebook instance.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they enable internet access, which could potentially expose the data to security risks.\n\nOption B is close but less optimal because copying the entire dataset to the ML storage volume may not be efficient or necessary, especially for large datasets.",
    "PossibleAnswers": [
        "A. Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC with SageMaker-provided internet access enabled Use an S3 ACL to open read privileges to the everyone group",
        "B. Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC and create an S3 VPC endpoint for the notebook to access the data Copy the JSON dataset from Amazon S3 into the ML storage volume on the SageMaker notebook instance and work against the local dataset",
        "C. Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC and create an S3 VPC endpoint for the notebook to access the data Define a custom S3 bucket policy to only allow requests from your VPC to access the S3 bucket",
        "D. Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC with SageMaker-provided internet access enabled. Generate an S3 pre-signed URL for access to data in the bucket"

    "QuestionText": "A large JSON dataset for a project has been uploaded to a private Amazon S3 bucket The Machine Learning Specialist wants to securely access and explore the data from an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance A new VPC was created and assigned to the Specialist\nHow can the privacy and integrity of the data stored in Amazon S3 be maintained while granting access to the Specialist for analysis?"
